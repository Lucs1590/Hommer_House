# üè† Hommer House

This was my TCC developed for real estate management at ETEC Professor Massuyuki Kawano in 2016. The idea was that with this software it would be possible to manage purchases, sales and rentals by real estate agencies.

This project was entirely developed in Delphi, highlighting that among the authors who followed the area and can be consulted, the following are mentioned:
  - [Lucas de Brito Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-brito100/)
  - [Lucas Lima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-lima-706ab0150/)
  - [Ruan Ricci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruan-ricci-de-andrade-b74410165/)
  - 

It is possible to find complete documentation about this course completion work, through the following document:

Furthermore, it is worth highlighting that the interfaces, documentations and codes were developed by Brazilians üáßüá∑, therefore, support is only available for this language.
